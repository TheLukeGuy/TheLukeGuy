### Hi! :wave:

I like to sometimes make things for fun, especially in Rust and Java.

I love low-level programming, retro computing, and video games. I'm most
interested in operating system & system emulator development and graphics
programming. I occasionally make mods and plugins for Minecraft.

You can find most of my older (pre-2020) projects [on GitLab][gitlab]. Also,
I've previously used the name "ConsoleLogLuke" here.
