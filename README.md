### Hi! :wave:

I like to sometimes make things for fun, especially in Rust and Java.

<p>

I love low-level programming, retro computing, and video games.
I'm most interested in operating system + system emulator development and graphics programming.
I occasionally make mods and plugins for Minecraft.

You can find most of my older (pre-2020) projects [on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/devluke).
Also, I've previously used the name "ConsoleLogLuke" here.
