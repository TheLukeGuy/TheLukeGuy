### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a (hobbyist) software developer!

My main project right now is my attempt at [recreating the Java Edition of Minecraft](https://github.com/ConsoleLogLuke/NXCraft) for platforms such as game consoles which usually are limited to the Bedrock Edition, which, unlike the Java Edition, is a buggy mess that's monetized with microtransactions.

I've always been really interested in [Nintendo homebrew](https://switch.homebrew.guide/gettingstarted/beforestarting.html) and [iOS jailbreaking](https://ios.cfw.guide/), which is the act of bypassing restrictions that Nintendo and Apple, respectively, have imposed on their platforms. The majority of my projects revolve around this.

I jump between languages quite frequently, but my favorite language is C++. I also love everything related to the JVM, which includes languages like Java and Kotlin. I strongly dislike Python and JavaScript, although both can be useful for small scripts.

- ðŸ“– Languages: C++, Java, Kotlin, Swift, Python, and JavaScript
- ðŸ“± Platforms: Desktop, Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Discord
